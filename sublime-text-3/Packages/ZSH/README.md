# sublime-zsh

A package containing native ZSH autocompletion and some useful snippets for ZSH development.

## Installation

### With Package Control

* Hit `cmd+shift+p`
* Type `Install package`
* Search for `ZSH`

## Autocompletion

sublime-zsh uses ZSH's built-in autocompletion, thanks to Vincent Breitmoser's [zsh-capture-completion](https://github.com/Valodim/zsh-capture-completion). As you type shell commands into your ZSH scripts in sublime, the next word is autocompleted as you type, just as it would be on the command line.

## Snippets

* `array`
* `function`
* `hash`
* `integer`
* `local`
* `shebang`
* `start`
* `zparseopts`
